“Jammeh knows better that he lost the confidence of the entire populace, he has been red-carded, humiliated and dumbed even before the polls,” read a post to the Gambia Youth and Women’s Forum Facebook page.
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
Following it were the hashtags #GambiaHasDecided #JammehMustGo.
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
Though the poster did not know it on January 6, 2017, the nearly 22 year rule of Yahya Jammeh over The Gambia was less than a month away from its end. President in name only, Jammeh governed harshly, and suppressed opposition wherever he could.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
The Gambia, the smallest county in West Africa, with a population of only 1.8 million, has only seen the mainstreaming of internet access in the last decade. Since it came to prominence, the first presidential election that occured resulted in the ousting of a long time dictator. There are many who say that this could not have happened without access to WhatsApp, Facebook, and other social media.
 
    </div>

    <div class="textbox" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
Gambia is a particularly interesting example of how increased access to the internet is affecting developing countries.

<h3 style="padding-bottom:0px;">The Gambia Under Jammeh  </h3>
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
In 1994, Yahya Jammeh took control of The Gambia as chair of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council, which toppled the regime of Dawda Jawara in a coup d'etat. The council immediately created a one party state and banned all political opposition activity, which would set the tone for the coming decades.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->



    <div class="textbox">
Two years later, in 1996, Jammeh was elected president. His rule was stamped with all the hallmarks of dictatorship. In 2008, he introduced anti-LGBT laws that he said would be “stricter than those in Iran.” He also stacked the country’s courts with foreign judges that took orders from him and imposed harsh sentences on those he took to be threatening his power.

    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox" >
Jammeh was also famous for his suppression of dissent, both in the press and on the streets. According to Freedom House’s annual report on press freedom, Gambia’s ranking steadily fell during Jammeh’s rule, sliding to its lowest point in 2016. Sentiments were often suppressed and more than 110 journalists went into exile. “Journalists had the worst time under his regime. He sees them as the enemies. He saw them as agents of the West. At one point he even described them as ‘illegitimate sons of Africa’, said Sulayman Makalo, a Gambian journalist and human rights activist and based in Boston.

    </div>
    <!--closes block-->




    <div class="textbox">
Similarly, Jammeh also violently suppressed protests. In 2000, he was accused of ordering the shooting deaths of 14 students and a journalist at a protest in the capital city of Banjul. Also, according to newspapers, many people were picked up by plainclothes police and disappeared to prisons, where they were held for years without due process.
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
In one bizarre episode in 2009, Jammeh even led a literal witch hunt campaign, during which the <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/africa/21gambia.html”> New York Times reported</a> that dozens of suspected practitioners of witchcraft were arrested and tortured.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
“His 22 year regime was characterized by fear, killings, disappearances, people fleeing the country, the country going down economy-wise, and all sorts of laws that were put in place to strengthen his rule,” said Makalo.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->


    <div class="textbox">
<h3>The Gambia Gets The Internet  </h3>
    </div>

    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
While Jammeh was busy doing all he could to strengthen his position and stifle dissent, a force beyond his control came to greater prominence in The Gambia: the internet.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
From 2009-2012, seven undersea fiber optic cables were laid off the coast of Sub-Saharan Africa, bringing a rush of broadband internet connectivity where there previously had been none. Pre-2009, according to a report by the US International Trade Commission, the entire west coast of Africa had been served by a single outdated fiber optic cable that was undependable and prone to outages.
    </div>



    <div class="textbox" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
The effects of these new cables were felt rapidly: the percentage of The Gambia’s population that had access to the internet more than doubled in five years, going from 6.88% in 2008 to 14% in 2013. This data was obtained from the International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations’ specialized agency for information and communication technologies. It is based on reports from the Gambian government as well as its own estimates.
    </div>
    <!--closes textbox-->


    <div id="box2"><img src="assets/images/graph1.png" style="padding-bottom: 50px;"></div>



    <div class="textbox" >
Demba Kandeh, a lecturer at the School of Journalism and Digital Media at the University of Gambia, says these numbers may be underestimated.
    </div>



        <div class="textbox">
“What is important in the context of Gambia is that, this is a communal society,” he said. “For example if I live in a joint family of around 15 people, which is the average, and one or two people have access to internet on the mobile phone, most of the family will use the same device.”
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->



        <div class="textbox" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
Internet use has continued to increase since the introduction of the undersea cables, and barriers, such as the cost of access, have fallen. Where the press was stifled, the internet was used to foment a growing political opposition in The Gambia.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div id="box2"><img src="assets/images/graph2.png" style="padding-bottom: 50px;"></div>



        <div class="textbox">
Exiled activists, journalists, and members of the large Gambian diaspora started Whatsapp groups, Facebook pages, Youtube channels, websites and blogs. Local activists helped people organize on a smaller level by tying these messages to the local candidates.
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

                <div class="textbox">
“At the time Gambia was politically a very very difficult environment for journalists and activists. And so the opposition groups had to meet discreetly. A lot of the activities were hidden, so the only activism that you could see was what was shared online,” said Kambeh.
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

                <div class="textbox">
“All this had a large impact on political discussion because Jammeh had complete control over the national media. The few private radio stations were not allowed to broadcast the news,” he said.
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->


                       <div class="textbox">
Facebook groups which were highly active during the year before the election are indicative of how exactly social media was used.

“When Adama Barrow was campaigning, he visited a remote village and held a meeting with the villagers there, and one of the village elders said to Barrow, ‘Mr. Barrow, you don’t have to come all the way here to tell us these things, we have Whatsapp now,” said Sanna Camara, a journalist based in Banjul, Gambia, who witnessed the campaigning.

         <div class="textbox">
Over the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa has seen innovations in citizen participation in governance that have relied on social media and increased internet access to get off the ground. 
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

     <div class="textbox">
Uganda was one of the first to participate in the trend. In 2011, the massive ‘Walk to Work’ protests occurred in response to spiraling food and fuel prices. Largely organized on social media, they continued to gain momentum and eventually resulted in a harsh crackdown from president Yoweri Museveni. 
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

             <div class="textbox">
At one point, the national media was even barred from live coverage of ‘Walk to Work’. Ugandans and the world at large found <a href=”https://cpj.org/blog/2011/04/ugandan-media-censored-over-walk-to-work-protests.php”>social media</a> as the only way to get updates on the protests, and the <a href=”https://www.voanews.com/a/mixed-legacy-for-ugandas-walk-to-work-protests-125587268/158497.html”> hundreds arrested.</a>

        <!--closes textbox-->

                     <div class="textbox">
Similar events occured in Ghana in 2014, when the largest anti-government protests in <a href=”https://www.pambazuka.org/activism/new-dawn-social-activism-ghana”> a decade</a> occurred against poor standards of living. Previously, protests were largely isolated to unions and the extreme poor, but the reach of social media platforms Facebook and Whatsapp allowed the specific demands of the younger generation (high youth unemployment) to be integrated into the larger movement.

In South Africa in 2015 and 2016, students united under the hashtag <a href=”https://theconversation.com/us/topics/feesmustfall-21801”>#FeesMustFall</a> to protest university tuition increases. They eventually secured concessions from the former president Jacob Zuma in the form a 10.7 percent increase in government subsidies for universities.

Citizens in Zambia utilized the internet and social media in its politics in a different way, by conducting <a href=”https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/social-media-internet-and-governance-zambia”>election monitoring</a> of polling places via Facebook. They were also able to share information from groups that were conducting independent tabulation of votes, the results of which closely mirrored official records.

<h3>The Gambian Diaspora 
  </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
The Gambian diaspora was so influential in this process, that activist politicians went to places with large concentrations of Gambians abroad, from Dakar to New York, to campaign. Gambian politicians canvassed for votes in these places, even though Gambians abroad cannot vote. “They wanted them to talk to their people back home directly,” says Kandeh.

        <!--closes textbox-->

        <div class="textbox">
Momodou Jallow who runs a DVD shop in Harlem, left Gambia 28 years ago, and has been living in New York City since. “People In Gambia felt like they couldn’t speak about what they saw or what they heard,” he said, “So we, in the diaspora saw the freedom people have elsewhere, and told our families and friends to change the situation in Gambia.”

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->
        <div class="textbox">
That it was impossible for the Gambian diaspora to return to their country for as long as Jammeh was in power, gave them all the more reason to be heavily invested in the elections and campaigning.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

        <div class="textbox">
 “Many of the people who left The Gambia during Jammeh’s rule left because they were not happy under  his rule, or were forced out by him.” said Camara. “If they wanted to see their families, they had to meet their relatives in neighbouring Senegal, but not in the Gambia.”

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

        <div class="textbox">
Even before local Gambians began to use the internet as a political tool, the diaspora recognized its potential and wanted to tap it, according to Makalo. “The young people were not engaged in politics that much because of the fear of the Jammeh regime.” he said, but the diaspora had the freedom to express their dissent abroad. The execution of nine prison inmates in 2012 first triggered an uproar in the diaspora, and people talked about it online. Videos of the diaspora protesting during Jammeh’s international visits were circulated online. These things had a profound influence on the people in the Gambia.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

            <div class="textbox">
The first of December 2016 was a significant day in the history of The Gambia. The country went to polls with Adama Barrow of the United Democratic Party defeating long-time incumbent Yahya Jammeh. It marked a big day for democracy in the country, marking the very first transfer of power by popular vote since independence from the United Kingdom in 1965.
        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
Fearing the potential of social media to turn around the results, internet was switched off in the country on the eve of the elections. In fact, on the days leading up to the election, speculations had been rife that this may happen, as the phenomenon isn’t particularly new to the continent.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
This move was met with stiff resistance, especially from the younger social-media-aware demographic. “On election night, everything was blocked out,” says Kandeh. Social media could not be accessed. Even international calls could not be made. We were completely isolated from the rest of the world.”

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
“That’s one mistake they made, shutting the internet down. If you look at Egypt, the reason why the Egyptian revolution succeeded is because of the social media shut down, When they shut it down, people started questioning what was going on. When the revolution started, the organizers were not that hopeful, but when the government shut the internet down, the people wanted to find out what was going on and that is how the protest started,” said Makalo.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
Despite the surprise results, The Gambia is still vulnerable to the threat of internet shutdowns, and policies which make it harder to gain internet access, as the government controls all the infrastructure.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
Kambeh thinks that if the elections had been held five years earlier, the result would have been completely different. “A lot of things that were possible in 2016 were not possible in 2011 for example. Even I was surprised that we were able to pull off the results that we did, to defeat him at the ballot box. This is largely because of the level of organization possible through technology,” he said.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->

    <div class="textbox">
Today, people are using social media to not just discuss politics, but also to coordinate local community projects. Jallow, the New York resident, is part of a Whatsapp group called Brikama, named after his hometown. Gambians coordinate with members of the diaspora to send food from abroad to one of Brikama’s mosques, where it is distributed to the locals. 

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->


    <div class="textbox">
“If our country is to succeed, then we must keep working to develop it, we must not stop, and Whatsapp and Facebook help us in some ways to do that,” said Jallow.

        </div>
        <!--closes textbox-->


    <div class="textbox">
Camara himself is a member of his village’s local development association. “We are using it to harness the potential of the diaspora and locals working together. We are currently coordinating the construction of a new market in the village,” he said.
