    If your alarm went on this morning and your first thought was to grab your phone and check Facebook, you’re not alone. According to a 2017 Deloitte global consumer survey, 89 percent of smartphone users admit to checking social media within the first hour of waking up. The same staggering numbers at night: 81 percent of responders look at their phones before going to bed.

    According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/">Statista</a>, as of January 2018, Facebook remains the leading social network, with 2.2 billion monthly active users, and closely followed by YouTube and WhatsApp.

    Social media is purposely designed that way: to make users engage, interact, and inevitably go down a rabbit hole of gifs, videos, listicles and likes. Glaring red notifications push the home screen, and looping, back-to-back videos fill up the newsfeed. Suddenly 10 minutes of scrolling during a work break quickly becomes 45. But… how?

    Nir Eyal, author of the book "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a>”, makes the case that successful social media sites and apps use the same technique that is behind slot machines- the variable ratio schedule.

    <div class="textbox" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
    In the 1930s. Harvard psychologist B.K. Skinner demonstrated this by getting rats in a box to hit a lever for food. He found that the rats hit the lever most frequently when the ratio of hits to receiving food changed every once in a while. Sounds familiar? You are the rat, and the irregular notifications you receive is the food, and the act of hitting the lever is constantly checking your phone.

    “Social media is quickly finding ways to to ‘game-ify’ or incentivize users more through rewards on action and usage--like Snapchat streaks, likes and retweets; ways to incentivize users to keep using the app. It gives the user a chance to have instant gratification because they advance one more day in the goal or streak they’re trying to meet. Like on Apple Watches they track your activity, you fill those circles up, and you get some sort of badge. It’s the same idea for social media: game-ifying it, being able to use your platforms regularly for self-gratification, and also share it with others,” said Ynah Santos, a self-employed web designer/social media consultant.

    Aaron Marcus researches the principles of effective visual communication in graphic user interface design. "The use of bright colors for danger signals, attention getters, reminders, and cursors is entirely appropriate," Marcus writes. “High chroma red-alerts seem to aid faster response than yellow or yellow-orange if brightness is equal. When too many figures or background fields compete for the viewer’s attention, confusion arises...simplicity, clarity, and consistency are especially important for color design.”

    <div class="textbox">
    Researcher Francine Frome also studied the spectral sequence in color coding, discovering red, green, and blue as the intuitive colors for a multi-layer display. As device screen brightness changes a viewer’s perception of depth, Frome discovered, the color red comes forward.

    “It’s true in terms of the color design that a lot of social media uses, especially what keeps their user base. Look at Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook; their main color is blue,” said Santos, 24. “Even with [Apple] iMessage, people prefer texting other blue iMessage users compared to the green regular text messaging. Your brain becomes more active and energized when you see the color blue. Even with the natural blue background light on our phones. A bunch of apps that use the color to entice you, not only as a soft vibrant color that expresses something joyful, but blue stimulates the brain enough to keep users engaged.”

    Santos also noted that, when working with e-commerce clients selling online products, the click-rate is much higher for blue ‘Buy Now’ buttons. Customers were more likely of going through the whole purchase from start to finish.

        Researchers at Google talked about the “funnel” video recommendation algorithm for YouTube, which boasts 1.5 billion consumers and uses what’s called a “candidate generation” and “ranking” network to filter through hundreds of recommendations, based on user’s query and search history. “The two-stage approach to recommendation allows us to make recommendations from a very large corpus (millions) of videos, while still being certain that the small number of videos appearing on the device are personalized and engaging for the user," they said.
